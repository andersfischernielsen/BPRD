//7.1
I ran the examples, and created a compile.bat to enable quick compilation.


//7.2
(i & ii)
See "arraysum_square.c" file for solution to exercise.

(iii)
See "histogram.c" file for solution to exercise.


//7.3
I modified "exec" in Interp.fs to allow for loops, so I wasn't "smart". 
The solution works, though. The lexer and parser have of course also been modified. 
See "arraysum_square_forloop.c" and "histogram_forloop.c" file for test of solution.


//7.4 & 7.5
The lexer, parser and Interp.fs have been modified to allow PreInc and PreDec. 
I added the tokens as ExprNotAccess types. I don't know if that was wrong.
